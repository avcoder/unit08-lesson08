# Aspects to Consider 

- Designing for smaller screens means limited input types
- Must use responsive design to avoid clutter
- Input Types include touch, gestures, voice (due to no keyboard/mouse)
- Accessibility: High contrast, readable fonts, screen reader support
- 2 Major Ways to build mobile apps:
   - Native: Platform specific (ex: Swift for Mac vs Kotlin/Java for Android)
   - Cross-Platform: One codebase for both (ex: React Native, Flutter)
- What kind of phone do you have to test with?

# Set up Default React Native project (pg.1)

- Install Expo Go > if it asks to find/connect to devices on your local network > Allow
- `npx create-expo-app --help` (OK to proceed? say yes)
- `npx create-expo-app helloworld`
- Once you see `✅ Your project is ready` then:
   - `cd helloworld`
   - go to package.json to find out how to start via `npm`
   - fyi: How can I start it without using `npm`?

# Set up Default React Native project (pg.2)

- a QR code comes up, scan it with your phone that already has Expo Go installed; should eventually see -->

## Exercise
- Take a moment to explore and poke around the folders/files
- Try changing `Welcome!` to `Hello World`
- Take 5 minutes and satisfy your curiosity
   - keep poking around, change/break stuff
- Report one thing you've discovered with the rest of the class in Zoom chat

# Set up BLANK React Native project

- `npx create-expo-app note-app -t`
   - choose Blank (TS) when prompted
- `cd note-app`
- `npm start`
- scan QR code > should see app via Expo Go 
   - if using iPhone: use camera app to scan QR code
   - if using Android: use Expo Go app to scan QR code
   - ensure phone is connected on same wi-fi as your computer

# Set up Blank React Native project

- Question: How can I inspect/debug on mobile?
   - Answer #1 try shaking your phone
   - Answer #2 try 3 touch hold - iOS only > reveals debug menu

## Exercise 

- You can also expose your app to anywhere in the world via `npm start --tunnel`
   - good if you wish to share your work with a co-worker, friend or client
   - Let's try it!

# Expo Go Framework Overview

- Expo is an Open Source React Native [framework](https://react.dev/learn/creating-a-react-app#expo)
   - similar to how Next.js is a React Framework; Nuxt.js is a Vue Framework
- Vanilla React Native gives us components to render text, views, scrollable lists, etc.
- Vanilla React Native doesn't give us out of the box nav, push notifs, using camera etc.
- Expo provides of tools and libraries that are not provided out of the box 
- Expo Go is a small part of Expo, so it's NOT the same as Expo
- Expo Go is a "sandbox" designed for learning, prototyping but isn't recommended when building production apps. You can't customize native code with it. It is designed to quickly get started building apps without spending time setting up your native dev env.
- What do you use to build production mobile React Native apps?   [Development Builds](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- We'll create 2 separate apps
   - First four classes we'll use Expo Go
   - Last 4 classes we'll eventually use Development Build

# Linting and Prettier

- `npx expo lint` > choosing Yes creates `.eslint.config.js`
- `npx expo install -- --save-dev prettier eslint-config-prettier eslint-plugin-prettier`
- see https://docs.expo.dev/guides/using-eslint/
   ```js
  const { defineConfig } = require('eslint/config');
  const expoConfig = require("eslint-config-expo/flat");
  const eslintPluginPrettierRecommended = require("eslint-plugin-prettier/recommended"); // add this

  module.exports = defineConfig([
    expoConfig,
    eslintPluginPrettierRecommended, // add this
    {
      ignores: ["dist/*"],
    }
  ]);
   ```

- goto App.tsx, notice how it uses single quotes?  Save file > should automatically change to double quotes

# Components: `<View>` `<Text>`

- `<View>` is like `<div>`, can have many of them, serves as a container tag for positioning and styling
  - unlike the web, everything in react native must be wrapped by a component
  - do NOT think of `<View>` as only one instance in existence (ex: MVC) - it's NOT that
- `<Text>` is like `<p>`; in React Native all text must be wrapped in a `<Text>`
   - this is because React Native will compile this appropriately to the UI elements based on the various platforms (ex: iOS, Android, etc)
- See the errors if you:
   1. put plain text
   1. put a Text component outside View
   1. use falsy values

transition: slide-left

# Inline Styles

- similar to css on the web except:
   - no units; everything is display points
   - defined as valid JS objects
   - no CSS animations

## Exercise
- Try wrapping our Text component in a View component
   ```tsx
   <View style={{ backgroundColor: "yellow" }}>
      <Text>Open...</Text>
   </View>
   ```
- Add some `paddingHorizontal: 8,`
- Add some `paddingVertical: 16,`
- Remove `alignItems: "center"`
- Notice styling uses flexbox (also default flex direction is column)

---
transition: slide-left

# More Exercises

- Try adding a `borderBottomColor: #123456`
- Don't see anything?   Try adding a `bottomBorderWidth: 1`
- ChatGPT: `in react native, when styling, I notice I'm using numberse that aren't pixels. Why?`
- Try importing PixelRatio from 'react-native' and output it via `<Text>{PixelRatio.get()}...`
- Let's style our Text component by
   - adding `fontSize: 18`
   - add `fontWeight: "200"`

---
transition: slide-left
---

# Styling Exercises

- Similar to how we had `.module.css`, let's create a separate stylesheet `./theme.ts` and move our styles into it (fyi - can't have global styles in R.N.)
   ```ts
   export const theme = {
      colorGreen: "#123456",
      colorWhite: "#ffffff"
      etc.
   }
   ```
- in our `const styles = StyleSheet.create({` in addition to container, let's add:
   - itemContainer
   - itemText
   ```ts
   itemContainer: {
      borderBottomWidth: 1,
      borderBottomColor: "#123456",
      paddingHorizontal: 8,
      paddingVertical: 16,
   },
   itemText: {
      fontSize: 18, fontWeight: "200"
   }
   ```

# Exercise: Create a Button

- R.N. does come with a Button element but is hardly used because you can't customize it.  
   - import `Button` from 'react-native' and use it:
   `<Button title="click me" />`
- Instead, let's import `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity`
   ```tsx
   <View style={styles.itemContainer}>
      <Text style={styles.itemText}>Hello</Text>
         <Pressable onPress={() => console.log('pressed')}>
            <Text>Delete</Text>
         </Pressable>
   ```
   - Try pressing the button.  Does terminal log out?
- Replace our `<Pressable>` with `<TouchableOpacity>`
   - Try adding prop `activeOpacity: 8` to change opacity 
   - add `flexDirection: "row,"` in `itemContainer`
   - add `justifyContent: "space-between",`
   - add `alignItems: "center"`

# Exercise: Style our Delete button

- Add to our `StyleSheet.create({` another key of `button`
- Try adding a `backgroundColor` of black to our button
- Try change font color to white via `<Text style={styles.buttonText}>Delete</Text>` and in our `StyleSheet.create` have a `buttonText: { color: theme.colorWhite }`
- Add some `padding`
- Add a `borderRadius`
- Add a `fontWeight: "bold",`
- Add a `textTransform: "uppercase",`
- Add `letterSpacing: 1,`

---
transition: slide-left

# Exercise: Adding alerts

- create a `handleDelete` function
   ```tsx
   const handleDelete = () => {
      Alert.alert("Are you sure you want to delete this?")
   }
   ```
   ```tsx
   <TouchableOpacity onPress={handleDelete}>
   ```
- Try it
- Try adding a second argument for subtext to `Alert.alert()`
- Try adding a 3rd argument:
   ```tsx
   [
      {
         text: "Yes",
         onPress: () => console.log('deleting'),
         style: "destructive",
      },
      {
         text: "Cancel",
         style: "cancel",
      }
   ]
   ```

---
transition: slide-left
---

# Exercise: Components

- create a `./components/` folder
- create `ShoppingListItem.tsx`
   - extract our item (i.e. `<View styles={styles.itemContainer}>...</View>`) into here
   - extract related files into it as well
   - extract related functionality into it
   - extract related imports
- import ShoppingListItem into App, try copying/pasting it 3 times to see if it shows up correctly
- okay now let's hard code 3 items via `name` prop `<ShoppingListItem name="mango">` etc
- add related TS if needed for prop
- modify ShoppingListemItem to display prop name
- Try changing `handleDelete` to change sentence to "Are you sure you want to delete insert-name-here"

transition: slide-left

# Exercise: Scratch off ToDo Item when Completed

- add any necessary styling as you see fit along the way
- add another prop `isCompleted?: boolean;`
- we want different styles if item is completed or not
   ```tsx
   <View style={[styles.itemContainer, isCompleted ? styles.completedContainer : undefined]}
   ```
- 💡 can change CompletedContainer styles to have different background colors etc.
   - similarly add custom styles for button when completed
   - similarly add custom styles for our item Text but use a `textDecorationLine: "line-through"` as well as any other colour changes

# Icon Buttons

- `npx expo install @expo/vector-icons`
- Try picking and copying an icon appropriate for Delete button
   - see https://icons.expo.fyi/Index
   - Copy import statement `import AntDesign from "@expo/vector-icons/AntDesign";`
   - Paste it in our `ShoppingListItem.tsx`
   - Copy the Render the component
- Replace our `<Text>Delete` component with your icon 
   ```tsx
   <AntDesign name="closecircle" size={24} color="theme.colorRed" />
   ```
   - may need to remove previous TouchableOpacity styles
- if item is completed, change button color to be grey
